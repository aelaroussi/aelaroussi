- 👋 Hi, I’m @aelaroussi
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, particularly in technologies like JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I love exploring new web technologies and frameworks to build efficient, scalable web applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about cloud computing services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) to enhance my skills in deploying and managing web applications at scale. I'm also diving into the world of serverless architectures to understand its benefits and challenges.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects focused on web development tools, libraries, or frameworks. I'm especially interested in contributing to projects that aim to improve web accessibility and performance.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via email at elaroussi@outlook.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/aelaroussi. Feel free to reach out for collaborations, discussions, or just to say hi!
